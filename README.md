# re_data

re_data lets data teams compute various metrics about their datasets and later on:
  - test
  - visualize
  - find anomalies in those

re_data is meant to help data teams find, debug data problems and sleep well knowing they you will know if something unexpected happens.

re_data works strictly inside your data warehouse - by doing transformations on your tables. It let's you improve your data without it needing to leave your data warehouse.
