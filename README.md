# re_data

re_data - is meant to help data teams fix data issues before users & CEOs would discover them ðŸ˜Š

re_data lets you compute various metrics about your datasets and later on:
  - test
  - visualize
  - find anomalies in those

re_data works strictly inside your data warehouse - by doing transformations on your tables. It let's you improve your data without it needing to leave your data warehouse.
